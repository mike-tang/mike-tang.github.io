				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>It's no secret that bank technologies are due for an upgrade. The fintech industry has made huge progress in digitizing our finances through the likes of PayPal, Venmo, Google, Apple, Square, and Stripe, but there's still a long way to go. Banks have an opportunity to holistically revolutionize the way people interact with their money.</p>
				<p>Chase Digital is on a mission to redefine banking through smart design and technology. I decided to join Chase because I believe that everybody deserves access to high quality institutional services like banking. From banking services and credit cards to loans and mortgages, there's no shortage of opportunities for Chase bank to create positive impact for its 90 million customers.</p>
