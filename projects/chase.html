				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>Money is indubitably a fundamental element of our society and culture. It's an underlying factor for almost everything we do and how we interact with others. Whether we like it or not, financial health begets quality of life and overall well-being for individuals and families. People need clarity and access to their money in order to make the best decisions for themselves, and financial institutions like banks are uniquely positioned to provide that for them.</p>
				<p>Chase Digital is on a mission to redefine banking through smart design and technology. With financial services ranging from banking and credit cards to loans and mortgages, there's no shortage of opportunities for Chase Digital to create positive impact for the bank's 90 million customers.</p>
				<p>I decided to join Chase Digital because I like solving tough problems. I'm drawn to the challenge of figuring out how complex banking systems and experiences can be redesigned to positively impact individual financial health. Reinventing the way people understand, manage, and use their money may seem like a daunting mountain to climb, but that just makes the journey more worth it.</p>
