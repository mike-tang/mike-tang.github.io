				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>The main purpose of <a href="http://www.demandforce.com/learn" target="_blank">Demandforce Learn</a> was to serve as a quick product overview for sales representatives and partners to use while traveling and speaking with potential customers. Since internet connectivity isn't always guaranteed at tradeshows or at various small business locations, DF reps needed an offline alternative to our website.</p>

				<h3>The Solution</h3>
				<p>To solve this problem, I designed and built a lightweight HTML5 webpage with smooth CSS3 transitions.</p>

				<img src="img/df-learn/df-wireframe-04.jpg" alt="Demandforce Learn wireframe, interaction design" />
				<p>The wireframes were relatively simple, so I skipped drafting mockups and went straight into developing and iterating on a prototype that would eventually launch as the live page.</p>
				<p>Without a doubt, this webpage needed to be <span class="bold">fluid responsive</span> so that it could cater to all types of mobile devices. I built a custom grid that responded to landscape and portrait views on tablets and phones, and used <a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVids.js</a> to make sure videos resized properly as well. To further improve performance and flexibility, I built an icon font with <a href="http://www.icomoon.io">IcoMoon</a>. Finally, I enabled <span class="bold">offline access</span> by listing all assets in the <span class="bold">cache manifest</span>, which tells the browser what to store in the application cache. The total size of the page (minus the video, which canâ€™t be cached) came out to <span class="bold">643kb</span> - just enough for a busy Demandforce representative to download within a few seconds in the office and head out to her next event.</p>
