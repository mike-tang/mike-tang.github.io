				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>As people's lives grow more dependent on mobile devices, battery consumption becomes a bigger problem. Not everyone carries their chargers wherever they go, and it doesn't help that businesses usually can't help you charge your phone, and outlets are generally hard to find.</p>
				<p><a href="https://www.doblet.com/" target="_blank">Doblet</a> is a network of batteries on demand that aims to relieve people from low battery life anxiety. The product is a combination of software and hardware - the mobile app detects when a phone's battery is running low and helps the user find the nearest Doblet charging device. Restaurants, bars, cafes, and other businesses can provide Doblet devices and give people an extra reason to drop in and stay longer.</p>
				<p>This particular project with Doblet involved startup branding, website design, and front end web development.</p>

				<h3>My Role</h3>
				<p>Sole product designer and front end developer. My design scope covered all digital aspects: product, interface, visual, logo, web, and everything in between. I was also responsible for coding the front end interface of the website, which was built on top of a Ruby on Rails back end.</p>

				<h3>Logo Redesign</h3>
				<p>I began the Doblet branding process by deconstructing the existing logo. The Doblet founders wanted to keep the existing concept behind the logo - a lightning bolt with a ring around it to indicate charging status, similar to the charging icon seen on the status bar in mobile devices. With that in mind, I redesigned the logo to fit a minimalistic style for the new website.</p>

				<p>We selected the bolt icon as an important design element that would be used consistently throughout the product's offerings. I reconstructed it as a symmetrical shape with an intent to look minimalistic and lightweight while also commanding a strong presence.</p>

				<h3>Website Design</h3>
				<p>The website design process took roughly two weeks from conception to live production. Here are a few snapshots of the process:</p>
