				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>As people's lives grow more dependent on mobile devices, battery consumption becomes a bigger problem. Not everyone carries their chargers wherever they go, and it doesn't help that businesses usually can't help you charge your phone, and outlets are generally hard to find.</p>
				<p><a href="https://www.doblet.com/" target="_blank">Doblet</a> is a network of batteries on demand that aims to relieve people from low battery life anxiety. The product is a combination of software and hardware - the mobile app detects when a phone's battery is running low and helps the user find the nearest Doblet charging device. Restaurants, bars, cafes, and other businesses can provide Doblet devices and give people an extra reason to drop in and stay longer.</p>
				<p>This particular project with Doblet involved designing their iOS app.</p>

				<h3>My Role</h3>
				<p>Product designer for Doblet's iOS app. Design scope included user experience, user interface, and visual design.</p>

				<h3>Product User Flow</h3>
				<p>First things first - an interface can only be as beautiful as the experience it comes with. We began the iOS app design process by creating a user flow map. I facilitated discussions with our team to ensure that we accounted for as many user interactions as possible. Since Doblet provides a service that involves both software and hardware, this step was absolutely essential in the UX design process.</p>

				<h3>iOS App Design</h3>
				<p>With the product user flow in place, it was easier to prioritize which UI elements to design first. Here are a few select screens from the design process:</p>
