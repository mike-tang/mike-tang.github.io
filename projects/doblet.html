				<h3>What is Doblet?</h3>
				<p>As people's lives grow more dependent on mobile devices, battery consumption becomes a bigger problem. Not everyone carries their chargers wherever they go, and it doesn't help that businesses usually can't help you charge your phone, and outlets are generally hard to find.</p>
				<p>Doblet is a network of batteries on demand that aims to relieve people from low battery life anxiety. The product is a combination of software and hardware - the mobile app detects when a phone's battery is running low and helps the user find the nearest Doblet charging device. Restaurants, bars, cafes, and other businesses can provide Doblet devices and give people an extra reason to drop in and stay longer.</p>
