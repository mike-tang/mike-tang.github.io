				<h3>What is JobQuest?</h3>
				<p>Whenever a friend complains to me about her/his career, I always respond with, "So what are you going to do about it?" There are two options: accept a state of complacency, or aspire to discover and pursue a true passion.</p>
				<p>JobQuest provides a medium for people to act upon their will and discover a career worth pursuing. The product aims to provide job seekers with a simple way to gain insight on different career paths, cull wisdom from experienced professionals, and get the best preparation possible for their dream job interview.</p>
