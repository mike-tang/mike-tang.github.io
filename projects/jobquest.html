				<h3>What is JobQuest?</h3>
				<p>Career decisions aren't easy. It's common to feel lost in the myriad of uncertainties that come with pursuing a new job or career path, especially when its consequences have a direct impact on quality of life.</p>
				<p>JobQuest was a design experiment that a friend and I decided to take on as a side project. Our goal was to design a platform for job seekers to gain insight on different career paths and cull wisdom from experienced professionals so that they could make better career decisions for themselves.</p>
