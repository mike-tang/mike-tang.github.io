				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>When pet caretakers encounter irregular behavior from their pets, they usually only have two options: wait to see if the problem goes away, or take them to the vet. Waiting to see if the problem eventually subsides is risky and worrisome. Alternatively, taking a pet to the vet can be expensive, inconvenient, and especially frustrating when a diagnosis reveals no problems at all.</p>
				<p><a href="http://kuddly.co" target="_blank">Kuddly</a> seeks to mitigate this problem for pet caretakers. The service allows them to connect directly with veterinarians through its mobile app and address everyday concerns regarding pet health and wellness.</p>

				<h3>My Role</h3>
				<p>Product designer. User experience and interface design lead. I provided design direction for the beta version of Kuddly's Android app.</p>

				<h3>Android App Design</h3>
				<p>With pet caretakers and veterinary professionals both targeted as Kuddly's primary users, we decided to split the app experience into two modes for each user type. We decided to house both user modes within a single Kuddly app instead of splitting it into two separate mobile apps because we wanted all users funneled into one seamless app experience.</p>
				<p>It's important to keep a product's experience consistent across platforms (e.g. web, mobile, Android, iOS) while also adapting to the design conventions of each platform. With this principle in mind, I designed Kuddly's Android app with sensible adherence to Google's Material Design guidelines while also recognizing that its features would need to be adapted iOS design guidelines.</p>
