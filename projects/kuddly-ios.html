				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>When pet caretakers encounter irregular behavior from their pets, they usually only have two options: wait to see if the problem goes away, or take them to the vet. Waiting to see if the problem eventually subsides is risky and worrisome. Alternatively, taking a pet to the vet can be expensive, inconvenient, and especially frustrating when a diagnosis reveals no problems at all.</p>
				<p><a href="http://kuddly.co" target="_blank">Kuddly</a> seeks to mitigate this problem for pet caretakers. The service allows them to connect directly with veterinarians through its mobile app and address everyday concerns regarding pet health and wellness.</p>

				<h3>iOS App Design</h3>
				<p>It's important to keep a product's experience consistent across platforms (e.g. web, mobile, Android, iOS) while also adapting to the design conventions of each platform. With this principle in mind, I designed Kuddly's iOS app after completing mockups for the Android app and adapted as many features as possible to iOS 7's design guidelines.</p>
