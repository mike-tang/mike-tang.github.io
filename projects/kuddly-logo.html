				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>When pet caretakers encounter irregular behavior from their pets, they usually only have two options: wait to see if the problem goes away, or take them to the vet. Waiting to see if the problem eventually subsides is risky and worrisome, and taking a pet to the vet can be expensive and inconvenient.</p>
				<p><a href="http://kuddly.co">Kuddly</a> seeks to mitigate this problem for pet caretakers. The service allows them to connect directly with veterinarians through its mobile app and address everyday questions about pet health and wellness.</p>
