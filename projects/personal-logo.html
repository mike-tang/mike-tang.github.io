				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>My favorite part of the creative process is the unexpected stroke of insight - that "aha" moment you painstakingly earn through grit, which frustratingly comes only after you stop searching for the answer.</p>
				<p>This logo concept was an indirect result of me taking a work break to ruminate over what problems I could aspire to solve through design and technology. Education, health, sustainability, human productivity - with so many important issues at hand, I find it very difficult to choose one over another. Hence, the motto and meaning behind this monogram of my initials [MT]:</p>
				<p class="italic">Life is about choosing which mountains are worth climbing.</p>
				<p>The mountains I choose to climb will always hold an uncertain future, but I'll certainly only be satisfied by trekking up the toughest ones. So for now, I'll just have to keep climbing, relentlessly reaching one summit after another, with each experience allowing me a hopeful stroke of insight that nudges me further along in the right direction.</p>

				<h3>My Role</h3>
				<p>Getting frustrated with my immense lack of self-understanding like <a href="https://youtu.be/1_BtlAw4trg?t=23s" target="_blank">this one girl we all might know.</a></p>
				<p>Staring deep into my soul and reflecting on life with intense passion like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuZE_IRwLNI&feature=youtu.be&t=5m45s" target="_blank">this guy.</a></p>
				<p>Deep introspection on the future I want for myself while listening to songs like <a href="https://soundcloud.com/velvetears/four-weeks" target="_blank">Four Weeks by The Dirac Sea</a> on repeat for weeks (not four though...).</p>
				<p>Some logo design too, I guess :)</p>
