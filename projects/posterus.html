				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>Growing up, some of us were lucky enough to have charismatic teachers that made learning fun and easy. Their mentorship inspired us to believe that we could do anything we set our minds to and effectively molded us into the individuals we are today.</p>
				<p>But there are also many of us who didn't get to enjoy that same experience. Many schools aren't able to attract and employ enough high quality educators to accommodate all of their students. Many parts of our world don't even have schools, let alone teachers. Great teachers are our world's most essential resource - they are the caretakers of our successive generations, but it's an unfortunate reality that they are inequitably distributed among those who need them most.</p>
				<p><a href="http://posterus.io" target="_blank">Posterus</a> is a startup project I've initiated that will aim to connect our world's best educators with learners anywhere, anytime. The primary goal (for now) of Posterus is to enable remote online learning for people all over the world.</p>

				<h3>Logo Design Process</h3>
				<p>Most startup founders probably don't start their businesses and begin by designing a logo, but for me it was the most important step in defining the company's purpose. Meaningful logo design is a rigorous process that involves deep introspection and forethought towards a product or company's direction. I kicked off this startup venture by designing a logo to ensure that Posterus was something our world needed me to build.</p>
				<p>"Posterus" is the Latin root word for <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/posterity" target="_blank">"posterity, descendants, future generations."</a> The idea for this name was inspired by my desire to build something that would positively impact my future children's quality of life. This underlying intention led me to direct my efforts with Posterus towards solving problems in education.</p>
				<p>With education and posterity as inspiration for a logo, my thoughts gravitated towards symbols related to growing seeds and kindling flames. In the realm of education technology, seeds seemed to me a bit too general and overused as a design concept, and any mark that looked like a flame would be too relatable to Tinder for my comfort.</p>
				<p>I started thinking about trees and growth. Redwoods and sequoias are the tallest and largest trees in the world, but even those have a limit on growth. What could possibly represent seeds, trees, flames, and an endless cycle of growth?</p>
				<p class="italic">Pine cones.</p>
				<p>Pine cones are the seeds of coniferous trees like redwoods and giant sequoias. Perhaps my favorite trait about pine cones is that they're an <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BOREASFire/" target="_blank">evolutionary adaptation to the presence of fire</a>, a destructive force turned into a positive and necessary reaction for activating an infinite cycle of growth and self-preservation.</p>
				<p>Children are the seeds of humankind. To ensure that our progress isn't lost, each generation passes on its knowledge to the next and kindles a love of learning that helps them grow. Posterus is an online education platform that enables educators to share their knowledge and assessment methods with peers and learners all over the world. With this in mind, it was an easy decision - there was nothing better that could represent it better than the pine cone.</p>
