				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Whenever a friend complains to me about her/his career, I always respond with, "So what are you going to do about it?" There are two options: accept a state of complacency, or aspire to discover and pursue a true passion.</p>
				<p>JobQuest provides a medium for people to act upon their will and discover a career worth pursuing. The product aims to provide job seekers with a simple way to gain insight on different career paths, cull wisdom from experienced professionals, and get the best preparation possible for their dream job interview.</p>

				<h3>The Solution</h3>
				<p>Many popular writers have divided foods into flesh-formers, heat-givers, and bone-formers. Although attractive from its simplicity, this classification will not bear criticism. Flesh-formers are also heat-givers. Only a portion of the mineral matter goes to form bone.</p>
				<img src="http://placehold.it/800x600" />
				<p>These last are not strictly foods, if we keep to the definition already given; but they are consumed with the true foods or nutrients, comprised in the other two classes, and cannot well be excluded from consideration.</p>
				<p>Water forms an essential part of all the tissues of the body. It is the solvent and carrier of other substances.</p>
				<p>Mineral Matter or Salts, is left as an ash when food is thoroughly burnt. The most important salts are calcium phosphate, carbonate and fluoride, sodium chloride, potassium phosphate and chloride, and compounds of magnesium, iron and silicon.</p>
