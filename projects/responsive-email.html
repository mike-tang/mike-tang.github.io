				<h3>My Role</h3>
				<p>Responsive design and code. I created fluid responsive email templates to improve the user experience of product communications across all devices, browsers, email clients, and mobile apps.</p>
			</section>

				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Believe it or not, email communications are part of the user experience too. They can be a vital method of delivering information to users, as long as they're used empathetically. When an email is important enough to be opened by a user, it's a developer's role to make it count.</p>
				<p>With that said, coding emails that work universally can be tricky. Devices come in various sizes, browsers understand code differently, and email clients and mobile apps provide varying degrees of support for HTML elements and CSS styling. There was a time when media queries would suffice to get responsive emails working on native Android and iOS mail apps, but their <a href="http://stylecampaign.com/blog/2012/10/responsive-email-support/">support across different email clients and apps is limited</a>.
				</p>

				<h3>The Solution</h3>
				<p>Fluid grids work in emails by creating nested table layouts with percentage widths rather than pixels. This method allows all text, images, and buttons to adjust according to device size.</p>
				<p>A maximum width is set on the parent table to restrict content from expanding too wide on the desktop view. Microsoft Outlook 2007/2010/2013 versions don't support max-width, but <span class="bold">conditional comments</span> for Outlook can be used to circumvent this issue.</p>
